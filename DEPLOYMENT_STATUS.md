   - Go to: https://github.com/Aisprintone/Sparrow/settings/secrets/actions
   - Add all required secrets listed above

2. **Set up Netlify Site**
   - Create a new site in Netlify
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Configure build settings:
     - Build command: `cd frontend && npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `frontend/out`

3. **Set up Cloudflare Workers**
   - Deploy your Cloudflare Workers
   - Update the KV namespace IDs in `wrangler.jsonc`
   - Configure your domain/subdomain

4. **Trigger Deployment**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Check: https://github.com/Aisprintone/Sparrow/actions
   - Monitor deployment status in real-time

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Verify setup
./scripts/verify-deployment-setup.sh

# Test deployment readiness
./scripts/test-deployment.sh

# Test frontend build
cd frontend && npm run build

# Test Cloudflare Workers build
cd cloudflare-workers/financeai-backend && npm run build

# Test Python backend
cd backend/python_engine && python -c "import api.main"
```

### Deployment URLs

Once configured, your services will be available at:
- **Frontend**: `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app`
- **Backend**: `https://financeai-backend.your-subdomain.workers.dev`

### Monitoring

The monitoring workflow will:
- Run every 6 hours automatically
