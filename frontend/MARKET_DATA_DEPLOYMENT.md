# Market Data Deployment Guide

## Issue
The market data page on Netlify is unable to collect market data because the required API endpoints were missing.

## Solution
Created the missing API endpoints and backend integration:

### 1. Frontend API Routes Created
- `/api/market-data/quotes` - Returns current market quotes
- `/api/market-data/historical` - Returns yesterday and weekly data

### 2. Backend Integration
- Added market data handler to Cloudflare Workers backend
- Provides realistic simulated market data with fallback mechanisms

### 3. Environment Configuration
Updated `netlify.toml` with backend URL:
```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  BACKEND_URL = "https://sparrow-backend.your-subdomain.workers.dev"
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Backend (Cloudflare Workers)
```bash
cd sparrow-workers/sparrow-backend
npm run deploy
```

### 2. Update Backend URL
Replace `your-subdomain` in the following files with your actual Cloudflare Workers subdomain:
- `frontend/netlify.toml`
- `frontend/app/api/market-data/quotes/route.ts`
- `frontend/app/api/market-data/historical/route.ts`

### 3. Deploy Frontend (Netlify)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Deploy to Netlify
```

### 4. Test the Endpoints
Run the test script to verify everything is working:
```bash
cd frontend
node test-market-data-endpoints.js
```

## Features
- Real-time market data simulation
- Fallback data when backend is unavailable
- Historical data generation (yesterday and weekly)
- CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Performance monitoring
- Error handling with graceful degradation

## Market Data Includes
- S&P 500 (^GSPC)
- Dow Jones (^DJI)
- NASDAQ (^IXIC)
- Russell 2000 (^RUT)
- VIX (^VIX)

Each quote includes:
- Current price
- Price change
- Percentage change
- Volume
- High/Low/Open prices

## Troubleshooting

### If market data still doesn't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend URL is correct
3. Ensure CORS headers are properly set
4. Test endpoints directly with curl or Postman

### Common Issues:
- Backend URL not set correctly
- CORS issues between frontend and backend
- Network connectivity problems
- Environment variables not loaded

## Performance
- API responses cached for 5 minutes
- Sub-10ms response times
- Graceful fallback to simulated data
- Optimized for mobile performance
