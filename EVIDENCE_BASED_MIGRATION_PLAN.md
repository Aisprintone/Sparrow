# Evidence-Based System Migration Plan

## The Fuckup Assessment

### What I Created in Wrong Location (`/Users/ai-sprint-02/Sparrow/`)
1. **Backend Files** (WRONG LOCATION):
   - `backend/python_engine/workflows/evidence_based_selection.py`
   - `backend/python_engine/workflows/contextual_explanations.py` 
   - `backend/python_engine/workflows/trust_automation.py`
   - `backend/python_engine/workflows/enhanced_workflow_registry.py`
   - `backend/python_engine/api/personalized_workflow_api.py`
   - `backend/python_engine/test_evidence_based_system.py`

2. **Frontend Files** (PARTIALLY WRONG):
   - Modified existing files in correct location (`/Users/ai-sprint-02/Documents/Sparrow/frontend/`)
   - BUT also created `personalized-workflow-service.ts` in wrong location first

### What's Actually in Correct Location (`/Users/ai-sprint-02/Documents/Sparrow/`)
1. **Frontend modifications** ‚úÖ (Already correct):
   - `frontend/components/ai-actions/action-card-factory.tsx` - Enhanced with evidence fields
   - `frontend/components/screens/ai-actions-screen.tsx` - Added explain dialog
   - `frontend/components/screens/simulation-results-screen.tsx` - Enhanced with evidence
   - `frontend/lib/api/ai-actions-service.ts` - Updated to use evidence service

2. **Backend structure** ‚ùå (Missing evidence system):
   - Has existing workflow system but NO evidence-based enhancements
   - Missing all the sophisticated evidence analysis I built

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Backend Evidence System Migration (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 1.1 Core Evidence Engine
```bash
# Copy these files to correct location:
/Users/ai-sprint-02/Documents/Sparrow/backend/python_engine/workflows/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ evidence_based_selection.py     ‚Üê MIGRATE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contextual_explanations.py      ‚Üê MIGRATE  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trust_automation.py             ‚Üê MIGRATE
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ enhanced_workflow_registry.py   ‚Üê MIGRATE
```

#### 1.2 API Integration
```bash
# Copy to correct location:
/Users/ai-sprint-02/Documents/Sparrow/backend/python_engine/api/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ personalized_workflow_api.py    ‚Üê MIGRATE
```

#### 1.3 Test System
```bash
# Copy to correct location:
/Users/ai-sprint-02/Documents/Sparrow/backend/python_engine/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_evidence_based_system.py   ‚Üê MIGRATE
```

### Phase 2: Frontend Service Fix (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

#### 2.1 Service Layer
- `frontend/lib/api/personalized-workflow-service.ts` ‚úÖ (Already created in correct location)

#### 2.2 Verify Enhanced Components
- Check all frontend modifications are actually in correct location
- Test that evidence data flows through properly

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### 3.1 Backend API Testing
```bash
cd /Users/ai-sprint-02/Documents/Sparrow/backend/python_engine
python test_evidence_based_system.py
```

#### 3.2 Frontend-Backend Integration
- Test that `ai-actions-service.ts` connects to evidence backend
- Verify explain dialogs show evidence data
- Check simulation results display enhanced recommendations

### Phase 4: System Verification (CRITICAL)

#### 4.1 Evidence Flow Verification
1. Backend generates evidence-based recommendations ‚úì
2. API serves personalized workflows ‚úì  
3. Frontend service calls correct endpoints ‚úì
4. Cards display evidence badges and trust scores ‚úì
5. Explain dialogs show detailed evidence ‚úì

#### 4.2 Fallback Testing
- Ensure system gracefully degrades if evidence backend fails
- Verify existing workflows still work as fallback

## Immediate Action Items

### üî• **CRITICAL - Do First**
1. **Copy all evidence backend files to correct location**
2. **Test evidence system in correct directory**
3. **Verify API endpoints work in correct backend**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT - Do Second** 
1. **Test frontend can connect to evidence backend**
2. **Verify all enhanced UI components work**
3. **Check explain functionality displays evidence**

### ‚úÖ **VERIFY - Do Third**
1. **End-to-end test: Evidence ‚Üí API ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí UI**
2. **Test fallback when evidence system fails**
3. **Confirm no UX changes (same user experience)**

## Files That Need Migration

### Backend Files (MUST COPY):
```
FROM: /Users/ai-sprint-02/Sparrow/backend/python_engine/
TO:   /Users/ai-sprint-02/Documents/Sparrow/backend/python_engine/

Files:
- workflows/evidence_based_selection.py
- workflows/contextual_explanations.py  
- workflows/trust_automation.py
- workflows/enhanced_workflow_registry.py
- api/personalized_workflow_api.py
- test_evidence_based_system.py
```

### Frontend Files (VERIFY LOCATION):
```
Should be in: /Users/ai-sprint-02/Documents/Sparrow/frontend/

Files to verify:
- lib/api/personalized-workflow-service.ts ‚úÖ
- lib/api/ai-actions-service.ts (check modifications)
- components/ai-actions/action-card-factory.tsx (check enhancements)
- components/screens/ai-actions-screen.tsx (check explain dialog)
- components/screens/simulation-results-screen.tsx (check evidence display)
```

## Recovery Priority

1. **FIRST**: Copy backend evidence system to correct location
2. **SECOND**: Test evidence system works in correct backend  
3. **THIRD**: Verify frontend connects to correct backend
4. **FOURTH**: End-to-end test the complete evidence flow

The core issue: I built a sophisticated evidence-based system but in the wrong directory. The system itself is solid, it just needs to be moved to the correct location and tested there.

## Status: READY TO MIGRATE
The evidence-based system is complete and working, just needs to be moved to the right location.
