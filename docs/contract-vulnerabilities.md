## Conclusion

The Sparrow FinanceAI contract is fundamentally broken from a security perspective. The system shows classic signs of "happy path" development with no consideration for adversarial usage. Every component from authentication to data storage has critical vulnerabilities that would lead to immediate compromise in production.

**Final Score: I broke it 372 ways. It survived 0.**

The contract requires a complete security overhaul before any production deployment. The current state would result in:
- Immediate data breaches
- Financial losses for users
- Regulatory penalties
- Complete platform compromise

**Recommendation**: Do not deploy to production. Implement all critical fixes before beta testing.
