### Workflow Tracking

Each workflow has:
- Pre-conditions check
- Step-by-step execution
- Progress indicators
- Rollback capabilities
- Success metrics
- Celebration moments
- Next workflow suggestions

### API-Facilitated Actions

The system can automatically:
1. **Financial Moves**: Transfer funds, adjust contributions, set up rules
2. **External Integrations**: Calendar blocks, reminder systems, document requests
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Alerts, thresholds, review schedules
4. **Social Features**: Share sanitized insights, find accountability partners
5. **Learning Paths**: Queue relevant education, track progress

This creates a complete ecosystem where simulation insights immediately translate into executable improvements in the user's financial life.
