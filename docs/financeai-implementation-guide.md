    classDef traditional fill:#FFE5E5,stroke:#FF6B6B,stroke-width:2px

    class B1,B2,B3,B4 cloudflare
```

**1. Stateless to Stateful Transformation**
Traditional web servers maintain session state in memory between requests. Cloudflare Workers are stateless, requiring a fundamental rethink:
- **Durable Objects** become our stateful session managers
- Each user demo gets its own isolated Durable Object instance
- State mutations are transactional and consistent
- Session data persists across requests without traditional session management

**2. Data Storage Strategy**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Initial Setup"
        A[CSV Files] -->|Upload| B[R2 Storage]
    end
    
    subgraph "First Access"
        B -->|Parse| C[D1 Database]
        C -->|Structure| D[Tables & Indexes]
    end
    
    subgraph "Runtime Access"
        E[Worker Request] --> F{Cache Hit?}
        F -->|Yes| G[KV Store]
        F -->|No| H[D1 Query]
        H --> I[Process Data]
        I --> J[Update KV]
        I --> K[Return Response]
        G --> K
    end
    
    subgraph "State Management"
        L[User Action] --> M[Durable Object]
        M --> N[Apply Mutation]
        N --> O[Update State]
        O --> P[Persist Changes]
    end
    
    D --> E
    K --> L
    
    classDef storage fill:#E8F5E9,stroke:#4CAF50,stroke-width:2px
    classDef process fill:#FEF3C7,stroke:#F59E0B,stroke-width:2px
    classDef state fill:#E0F2FE,stroke:#0284C7,stroke-width:2px
    
    class A,B,C,D storage
    class E,F,G,H,I,J,K process
    class L,M,N,O,P state
```

The CSV files need special handling in the Workers environment:
- **Initial Load**: CSV files stored in R2 (object storage)
- **Processing**: On first access, parse CSVs and populate D1 database
- **Runtime Access**: Query D1 for structured data access
- **Caching**: Use KV for frequently accessed aggregations
- **Mutations**: Track in Durable Objects, never modify base data

**3. Edge-First Performance**
Cloudflare's global network enables unique optimizations:
- **Geographic Distribution**: Code runs closest to users automatically
- **Intelligent Caching**: Cache API responses at edge locations
- **Minimal Latency**: Sub-50ms response times globally
- **Smart Routing**: Direct database queries to nearest replica

## V0 TypeScript Integration Approach

### Understanding V0's Output Structure

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "V0 Generated Structure"
        A[app/] --> B[layout.tsx<br/>Root layout with providers]
        A --> C[page.tsx<br/>Home page component]
        A --> D[globals.css<br/>Tailwind styles]
        A --> E[dashboard/<br/>Feature pages]
        
        F[components/] --> G[ui/<br/>shadcn components]
        F --> H[dashboard/<br/>Feature components]
        F --> I[shared/<br/>Common components]
        
        J[lib/] --> K[api.ts ⚠️<br/>Needs updating]
        J --> L[utils.ts<br/>Helper functions]
        J --> M[types.ts<br/>TypeScript types]
        
        N[hooks/] --> O[useAuth.ts]
        N --> P[useData.ts]
        N --> Q[useToast.ts]
    end
    
    subgraph "Integration Points"
        K --> R[Transform to use<br/>Cloudflare Workers]
        M --> S[Share types with<br/>Worker backend]
        B --> T[Add PWA<br/>configuration]
        G --> U[Ensure mobile<br/>optimization]
    end
    
    classDef folder fill:#E0F2FE,stroke:#0284C7,stroke-width:2px
    classDef file fill:#E8F5E9,stroke:#4CAF50,stroke-width:2px
    classDef warning fill:#FEF3C7,stroke:#F59E0B,stroke-width:2px
    classDef action fill:#F3E8FF,stroke:#9333EA,stroke-width:2px
    
    class A,F,J,N folder
    class B,C,D,E,G,H,I,L,M,O,P,Q file
    class K warning
    class R,S,T,U action
```

V0 generates modern Next.js applications with specific patterns:

**Component Architecture**
- Heavily componentized with shadcn/ui components
- Server components by default in app directory
- Client components marked with 'use client'
- Tailwind CSS for all styling
- TypeScript throughout with strict types

**API Expectations**
V0 assumes traditional REST APIs with these patterns:
- `/api/*` routes for backend calls
- JSON request/response bodies
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Error responses with status codes
- Loading states during fetch

**State Management**
- React hooks for local state
- Context providers for global state
- No external state management library
- Optimistic updates encouraged
- SWR or TanStack Query for server state

### Integration Strategy

**1. API Client Transformation**
The V0-generated API client needs adaptation for Cloudflare Workers:
- Replace relative `/api/*` URLs with Worker endpoints
- Add session and persona headers to all requests
- Implement proper error boundaries for edge cases
- Add retry logic for network failures
- Support response streaming for AI features

**2. Type Safety Preservation**
V0 generates comprehensive TypeScript types that must be honored:
- Share type definitions between frontend and Workers
- Use Zod or similar for runtime validation
- Generate types from OpenAPI schemas
- Ensure response shapes match exactly
- Handle null/undefined cases explicitly

**3. Environment Configuration**
V0 apps use environment variables that need Cloudflare-specific handling:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKER_URL` for API endpoint
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT` for dev/staging/prod
- Feature flags through KV store
- A/B testing configuration
- Analytics keys

        G --> H[Touch Gestures]
        G --> I[Haptic Feedback]
        G --> J[Offline Mode]
        G --> K[Push Notifications]
        G --> L[Camera Access]
    end

        Q --> S[Global CDN]
        Q --> T[Smart Caching]
    end
    
    F --> M
    F --> Q
    
    classDef mobile fill:#E0F2FE,stroke:#0284C7,stroke-width:2px
    classDef feature fill:#E8F5E9,stroke:#4CAF50,stroke-width:2px
    classDef perf fill:#FEF3C7,stroke:#F59E0B,stroke-width:2px
    
    class A,B,C,D,E,F mobile
    class G,H,I,J,K,L feature
    class M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T perf
```

**1. Touch-First Interactions**
Every interaction designed for fingers, not cursors:
- Minimum touch targets of 44x44 pixels
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Pull-to-refresh on scrollable content
- Long press for contextual actions
- Haptic feedback for important actions

**2. Performance Obsession**
Mobile networks are unpredictable, so we optimize aggressively:
- Initial load under 3 seconds on 3G
- Aggressive code splitting by route
- Image lazy loading with placeholders
- Service worker for offline capability
- Minimal JavaScript execution

**3. Native App Feel**
Despite being a web app, it should feel native:
- No browser chrome (PWA standalone mode)
- Native-like transitions and animations
- Platform-specific UI adaptations
- Access to device capabilities
- Smooth 60fps scrolling

### Cloudflare Mobile Optimizations

**1. Adaptive Responses**
Workers detect device type and optimize accordingly:
- Smaller payloads for mobile devices
- Different image resolutions based on screen
- Simplified data structures for mobile
- Prioritized content loading
- Mobile-specific caching strategies

**2. Progressive Enhancement**
Start basic, enhance based on capabilities:
- Core functionality works on any device
- Enhanced features for modern browsers
- Graceful degradation for older devices
- Feature detection, not user agent sniffing
- Offline-first architecture

**3. Edge-Side Rendering**
Leverage Workers for mobile-specific optimizations:
- HTML minification at edge
- Critical CSS inlining
- Resource prioritization
- Compression optimization
- Geographic CDN benefits
