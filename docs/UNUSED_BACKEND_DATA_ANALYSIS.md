- `peer_comparison` - Demographic peer benchmarks
- `market_context` - Current market conditions impact
- `personalization_score` - How well recommendations fit user
- `action_dependencies` - Related actions that should be taken together
- `seasonal_relevance` - Time-sensitive opportunities

### Potential Use Cases:
- Behavioral coaching messages
- Peer comparison charts
- Market-aware recommendations
- Personalization indicators
- Action bundling for efficiency
- Seasonal reminder system

## 7. Workflow System Data

### Currently Unused Workflow Metrics:
- `workflow_history` - Past automation executions
- `success_rate` - Historical success percentage
- `average_completion_time` - Typical execution duration
- `failure_reasons` - Common failure patterns
- `optimization_opportunities` - Workflow improvement suggestions

### Potential Use Cases:
- Automation reliability scores
- Performance trending
- Failure prevention alerts
- Workflow optimization recommendations

## 8. Cache Performance Data (`/cache/stats`)

### Currently Unused Metrics:
- `cache_hit_rate` - Performance optimization metric
- `response_times` - API latency tracking
- `data_freshness` - Last update timestamps

### Potential Use Cases:
- Performance dashboard for power users
- Data freshness indicators
- System health monitoring

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Quick Wins):
1. **Credit utilization** from account data (simple calculation, high value)
2. **Spending categories** from transactions (already calculated, just needs display)
3. **Peer comparison** from AI system (motivational, already available)
4. **Interest rates** display (helps with debt prioritization)

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Features):
1. **Time series projections** from simulations (visual impact)
2. **Goal momentum** indicators (motivational)
3. **Behavioral insights** messages (personalization)
4. **Institution diversity** analysis (security awareness)

### Low Priority (Power User Features):
1. **Sensitivity analysis** controls
2. **Workflow performance** metrics
3. **Cache performance** dashboard
4. **Risk metrics** (VaR, CVaR)

## Data Integration Recommendations

### For Autocompact Feature:
1. **Create data density settings**: Allow users to choose between "Simple", "Detailed", and "Power User" views
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Start with essential data, expand on user interaction
3. **Smart summaries**: Use AI to summarize complex data into actionable insights
4. **Contextual display**: Show relevant unused data based on user's current screen/action

### Technical Considerations:
- All data is already available via existing APIs
- No backend changes required
- Focus on frontend display optimization
- Consider lazy loading for detailed data
- Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed metrics

## Conclusion

The backend provides significantly more data than currently displayed. The autocompact feature should prioritize:
1. High-value, easy-to-implement metrics
2. Data that enhances decision-making
3. Information that increases user engagement
4. Metrics that differentiate from competitors

This unused data represents an opportunity to create a more comprehensive and valuable user experience without additional backend development.
