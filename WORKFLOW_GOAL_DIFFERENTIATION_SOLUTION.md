# Workflow vs Goal Differentiation Solution

## Overview

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can see that you currently have AI actions and simulation cards that are all treated as workflows, but you need to differentiate between **automation workflows** (things that can be automatically executed) and **goals** (long-term financial objectives that users should track and work towards).

## Current State Analysis

### AI Actions Cards
- Located in `frontend/components/screens/ai-actions-screen.tsx`
- Currently all actions have an "Automate" button (blue)
- Actions are tagged with workflow IDs but no differentiation between automation vs goals
- Examples: "Cancel Unused Subscriptions", "Move to High-Yield Savings"

### Simulation Cards  
- Located in `frontend/components/screens/simulation-setup-screen.tsx`
- Generate AI action plans that become workflow cards
- Currently all treated as automation workflows
- Examples: "Emergency Fund Builder", "Debt Avalanche Strategy"

### Goal System
- Located in `frontend/lib/data.ts` and `frontend/components/screens/goals-screen.tsx`
- Well-structured with progress tracking, milestones, and AI insights
- Examples: "Emergency Fund", "Bali Vacation", "Home Down Payment"

## Solution: Workflow Type Classification

### 1. Enhanced Workflow Type System

```typescript
// Add to frontend/lib/data.ts
export interface WorkflowMetadata {
  id: string
  type: "automation" | "goal" | "hybrid"
  category: "optimize" | "protect" | "grow" | "emergency"
  difficulty: "easy" | "medium" | "hard"
  automationLevel: "full" | "partial" | "manual"
  goalAlignment?: string[] // Array of goal IDs this workflow supports
  estimatedDuration: string
  potentialImpact: {
    immediateSavings?: number
    annualProjection?: number
    goalProgress?: number
  }
}

// Enhanced AIAction interface
export interface AIAction {
  // ... existing properties
  workflowType: "automation" | "goal" | "hybrid"
  goalId?: string // If this action creates/contributes to a goal
  automationAvailable: boolean
  goalCreationAvailable: boolean
}
```

### 2. Workflow Classification Logic

```typescript
// Add to frontend/lib/services/workflow-classifier.ts
export class WorkflowClassifier {
  static classifyAction(action: AIAction): "automation" | "goal" {
    const automationKeywords = [
      "cancel", "negotiate", "transfer", "optimize", "switch", 
      "consolidate", "refinance", "rebalance"
    ]
    
    const goalKeywords = [
      "build", "save", "create", "establish", "develop", 
      "achieve", "reach", "maintain", "grow"
    ]
    
    const title = action.title.toLowerCase()
    
    if (automationKeywords.some(keyword => title.includes(keyword))) {
      return "automation"
    }
    
    if (goalKeywords.some(keyword => title.includes(keyword))) {
      return "goal"
    }
    
    // Default based on action type
    return action.type === "optimization" ? "automation" : "goal"
  }
  
  static getGoalAlignment(action: AIAction): string[] {
    const goalMappings: Record<string, string[]> = {
      "Emergency Fund": ["emergency_fund", "safety_net"],
      "High-Yield Savings": ["emergency_fund", "savings"],
      "Debt Payoff": ["debt_reduction", "financial_freedom"],
      "Investment Portfolio": ["retirement", "wealth_building"],
      "Home Purchase": ["home_purchase", "housing"],
      "Travel Fund": ["travel", "experience"]
    }
    
    return goalMappings[action.title] || []
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Card Rendering

```typescript
// Update frontend/components/screens/ai-actions-screen.tsx
const renderActionCard = (action: AIAction) => {
  const workflowType = WorkflowClassifier.classifyAction(action)
  const isAutomation = workflowType === "automation"
  const isGoal = workflowType === "goal"
  
  return (
    <GlassCard className="...">
      {/* ... existing card content ... */}
      
      {/* Action buttons with differentiation */}
      <div className="flex gap-2 p-6 pt-0">
        <Button 
          size="sm" 
          variant="outline"
          className="border-gray-600 text-gray-300 hover:bg-gray-700 flex-1"
          onClick={() => handleLearnMore(action)}
        >
          Learn More
        </Button>
        
        {isAutomation && (
          <Button
            size="sm"
            className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-purple-600 text-white flex-1"
            onClick={() => handleAutomate(action)}
          >
            Automate
          </Button>
        )}
        
        {isGoal && (
          <Button
            size="sm"
            className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-600 to-emerald-600 text-white flex-1"
            onClick={() => handleCreateGoal(action)}
          >
            Add Goal
          </Button>
        )}
        
        {workflowType === "hybrid" && (
          <div className="flex gap-2 flex-1">
            <Button
              size="sm"
              className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-purple-600 text-white flex-1"
              onClick={() => handleAutomate(action)}
            >
              Automate
            </Button>
            <Button
              size="sm"
              className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-600 to-emerald-600 text-white flex-1"
              onClick={() => handleCreateGoal(action)}
            >
              Add Goal
            </Button>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </GlassCard>
  )
}
```

### 4. Goal Creation Handler

```typescript
// Add to frontend/components/screens/ai-actions-screen.tsx
const handleCreateGoal = (action: AIAction) => {
  const goalData = {
    title: action.title,
    type: determineGoalType(action),
    target: calculateTargetAmount(action),
    current: 0,
    deadline: calculateDeadline(action),
    icon: getGoalIcon(action),
    color: getGoalColor(action),
    monthlyContribution: calculateMonthlyContribution(action),
    priority: "medium" as const,
    status: "active" as const,
    simulationTags: WorkflowClassifier.getGoalAlignment(action),
    milestones: generateMilestones(action)
  }
  
  addGoal(goalData)
  setCurrentScreen("goals")
  
  toast({
    title: "Goal Created",
    description: `${action.title} has been added to your goals.`,
  })
}

const determineGoalType = (action: AIAction): Goal["type"] => {
  const typeMappings: Record<string, Goal["type"]> = {
    "Emergency Fund": "safety",
    "High-Yield Savings": "safety", 
    "Debt Payoff": "debt",
    "Investment Portfolio": "investment",
    "Home Purchase": "home",
    "Travel Fund": "experience"
  }
  
  return typeMappings[action.title] || "other"
}
```

### 5. Simulation Results Enhancement

```typescript
// Update frontend/components/screens/results-screen.tsx
const renderSimulationAction = (action: AIActionPlan) => {
  const workflowType = WorkflowClassifier.classifyAction(action)
  
  return (
    <Card key={action.id} className="...">
      {/* ... existing content ... */}
      
      <div className="flex gap-2 mt-4">
        {workflowType === "automation" && (
          <Button
            className="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white"
            onClick={() => handleAutomate(action)}
          >
            Automate
          </Button>
        )}
        
        {workflowType === "goal" && (
          <Button
            className="bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white"
            onClick={() => handleCreateGoal(action)}
          >
            Add Goal
          </Button>
        )}
        
        {workflowType === "hybrid" && (
          <div className="flex gap-2 w-full">
            <Button
              className="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white flex-1"
              onClick={() => handleAutomate(action)}
            >
              Automate
            </Button>
            <Button
              className="bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white flex-1"
              onClick={() => handleCreateGoal(action)}
            >
              Add Goal
            </Button>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </Card>
  )
}
```
